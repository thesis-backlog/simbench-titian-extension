# Simbench-TiTIAN: An Open-Source Reinforcement Learning Environment for Topology Optimisation in Highly Loaded Distribution Grids

This repository provides a structured, open-source Gymnasium-compatible environment for reinforcement learning (RL) research on topology-based congestion management in high-voltage distribution networks. The environment integrates SimBench grid models, time-series operational data, and AC load flow analysis using pandapower.

## üîç Project Highlights

- Based on publicly available [SimBench](https://www.simbench.net/) grid models with variable load and generation profiles
- Uses [pandapower](https://www.pandapower.org/) for power flow simulation and validation
- Implements a Gymnasium-compatible RL environment for circuit breaker control
- Trains a PPO agent via [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/) for congestion mitigation
- Features reward functions and penalties for realistic grid stability conditions
- Supports action filtering (e.g., NodeSplittingExEHVCBs) and dictionary-based observations
