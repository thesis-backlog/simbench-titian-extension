# Simbench-TiTIAN: An open-source reinforcement learning environment for topology optimisation in highly loaded distribution grids

This repository hosts the source code for **Simbench-TiTIAN**, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning environment for congestion management and topology optimization in high-voltage power grids.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Built on [SimBench](https://www.simbench.net/) grid models
- Uses [pandapower](https://www.pandapower.org/) for load flow
- RL agent based on [Stable-Baselines3 PPO](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/)
- Observation and action space tailored for dynamic switching of circuit breakers

## 📂 Current Contents

## 🚧 Work in Progress
The repository will soon include:
- Training scripts and configurations
- Jupyter notebooks for demos and evaluation
- Logging, evaluation, and visualization tools
- License and contributing guidelines

## 📜 License
To be added before public release.
